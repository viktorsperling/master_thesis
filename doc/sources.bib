It measures the performance of the current Akamai platform and considers a key architectural question faced by both CDN designers and their prospective customers: whether the co-location approach to CDN platforms adopted by Akamai, which tries to deploy servers in numerous Internet locations, brings inherent performance benefits over a more consolidated data center approach pursued by other influential CDNs such as Limelight. We believe the methodology we developed for this study will be useful for other researchers in the CDN arena.},

@inproceedings{simon_thesis,

	title = {Conception and Prototypical Implementation of a Web Components Based Library in the Context of Reusability},
	year = {2021},
	abstract = {This thesis gives an overview of the current state of Web Components, the browser support, technologies to develop Web Components, and existing Web Components li- braries. Furthermore, a prototype of a Web Components library is created with focus on the aspect of reusability.
	Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer are examined in this thesis with regard to their support of the Web Components standard. As a result, it was shown that the former four browsers all fully support the standard. Safari, however, has decided not to implement the aspect of custom built-in elements. While this has to be taken into consideration, it does not affect the development of a library with new custom components. Internet Explorer has never offered any support for Web Components and, since it is no longer actively maintained, will not support it. Thus, it can be concluded that most modern and popular browsers are supporting Web Components. Furthermore, it can be assumed that browsers which are still actively developed but have not included the support yet will eventually implement it.
	The standard, however, is not perfect yet. There are still issues, such as the limitation that the same component tag can only be registered once. It is discussed if this is solved by adding a new standard to scope the new elements. This shows that the standard is still maintained and further developed. As a result, it is safe to conclude that there is currently no trend away from Web Components. This is underlined by the growing popularity of technologies to create Web Component and already existing libraries.
	Stencil is used as the main technology to develop the prototype. The creation of Web Components does not require an additional compiler such as Stencil and can be written with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as shown by the GitHub Time Elements. This, however, is only recommended for smaller and less complex components. Stencil already covers aspects such as testing, applying polyfills, and integrating the components into Angular or Vue.js projects in its core. Additionally, Stencil’s weekly download numbers have increased continuously since January 2021 which shows that there is currently no trend away from Stencil. Hence, the usage of Stencil can be suggested for the creation of a Web Components library.
	The developed prototype can be classified as reusable. It fulfills the criteria which are defined in the text, since reusability itself is not measurable. A working set of tested and documented components were created which can be integrated into Angular and Vue.js and further customized. Thus, these Web Components can be used in different environments and logical use cases.},
